-----PRE REQUISITES----
1) WHAT ARE TUPLES?
-> A tuple has different types of data types stored under it in parenthesis, it is immutable -> that means it doesn't allow the changes once it is created, it allows duplicates, also these are ordered. 
index -> 0 to n-1

2) WHAT ARE LISTS?
-> A list too has different types of data types stored under it in square braces, it is mutable -> that means it allow the changes once it is created, it allows duplicates, also these are ordered. 
index -> 0 to n-1

the code is based on python using list and tuples with for loop and conditional statements to create an environment of quiz game.
here the questions are based on c language moderate questions


in the question tuple you can make changes by adding the questions that you want in your quiz
also according to the questions you can change the answers and options tuples too.
